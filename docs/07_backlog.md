## P1

### P1-001 — Google Docs real adapter

Status: **Done (2026-05-15)** — Docs adapter upgraded from Sprint-0 stateful
mock to mock-first + real-mode httpx-backed REST. Real mode activates
when both ``Settings.google_oauth_access_token`` (SecretStr) and
``Settings.google_docs_api_base`` are set (the base defaults to the prod
Docs URL, so an operator providing only a bearer flips real mode on).
Partial config — e.g. base URL override without a bearer — falls back to
the deterministic mock so half-real behaviour can't surprise a PM.

Real-mode operations:
- ``google.docs.create_doc`` / ``google.docs.create_proposal_outline`` →
  ``POST /v1/documents`` with body ``{"title": ...}``. When the action
  payload carries ``sections``, follows with
  ``POST /v1/documents/{documentId}:batchUpdate`` to insert each section
  heading as a separate ``insertText`` at ``endOfSegmentLocation``.
- ``google.docs.append_section`` → single ``insertText`` at
  ``endOfSegmentLocation`` with heading + body.

Deep-review C1 honored: real mode short-circuits ``dry_run=True`` to a
synthetic ``dry_run_<sha1(key)[:8]>`` preview BEFORE any HTTP call.
``Settings.dry_run_default=True`` is the hot path; silent writes would
violate CLAUDE.md rule #3.

Error redaction follows the Plane / Drive contract: HTTPStatusError →
``safe_error_summary`` (M8, structured fields only, 200-char cap);
``httpx.HTTPError`` + ``httpx.InvalidURL`` → ``safe_network_summary``
(round-3 M4, class name only, ``str(exc)`` dropped). Document titles
and batchUpdate bodies carry user content — leaking ``str(exc)`` would
re-introduce M8 / M4.

Out of scope: cross-API idempotency via Drive ``files.list`` (Docs API
has no native name lookup; would couple this adapter to Drive auth
scope + a parent_id the current ``ExternalAction`` payload doesn't
carry). OAuth refresh stays operator-driven via the access-token
field. 429 backoff deferred.

The Stage-4 "no httpx in adapter source" guard relaxed to also exempt
``google_docs`` (alongside ``google_drive`` from P1-005). Sheets and
Calendar remain pure mocks until P1-002 / P1-003. The guard was
tightened to use AST import inspection rather than substring grep
because the Docs ``batchUpdate`` payload carries an upstream JSON key
literally named ``"requests"``.

Tests: 14 new in ``tests/test_docs_real_adapter.py`` covering real_mode
toggle (3), create_doc endpoint + body + URL shape (4), batchUpdate
section insertion (1), dry_run safety on both create + append (2),
401 / network-error / InvalidURL redaction on create (3),
network-error redaction on append (1). All use ``httpx.MockTransport``
so the suite stays offline.

### P1-002 — Google Sheets real adapter

Status: **Done (2026-05-15)** — Sheets adapter upgraded from Sprint-0
stateful mock to mock-first + real-mode httpx-backed REST. Bearer-only
``real_mode`` (issue-1 pattern); ``google_sheets_api_base`` defaults to
the prod Sheets URL and is configuration, not a gate. The structural
AST guard in ``tests/test_google_workspace_adapters.py`` was extended
to cover sheets_mod alongside drive_mod + docs_mod.

Real-mode operations:
- ``google.sheets.append_tracking_row`` / ``google.sheets.append_rows`` →
  ``POST /v4/spreadsheets/{id}/values/{range}:append`` with
  ``valueInputOption=USER_ENTERED`` query param. Body is
  ``{"values": [[...]]}`` — 2D array, each inner list is a row. Row
  dicts are serialised by ``dict.values()`` in insertion order; v1
  assumes rows share keys (the planner emits this naturally). Default
  range when payload omits one: ``Sheet1``.
- ``google.sheets.update_cells`` →
  ``POST /v4/spreadsheets/{id}/values:batchUpdate``. Body is
  ``{"valueInputOption": "USER_ENTERED", "data": [{"range": "A1",
  "values": [["v"]]}, …]}`` — each cell is its own data entry with a
  1x1 values array.

Safety properties follow Plane / Drive / Docs:
- Deep-review C1 — dry_run short-circuits BEFORE any HTTP call,
  returns ``dry_run_<sha1(sheet_id)[:8]>`` synthetic preview. Fallback
  to action_id when sheet_id is missing (issue-5 pattern).
- M8 + round-3 M4 — HTTPStatusError → ``safe_error_summary``;
  HTTPError + InvalidURL → ``safe_network_summary``. Row values and
  cell contents carry user content; leaking ``str(exc)`` would
  re-introduce M8 / M4.
- Stage-4 httpx guard exempts sheets_mod (alongside drive_mod +
  docs_mod). Calendar remains pure mock until P1-003.

Out of scope (deferred follow-ups):
- Idempotency. Sheets has no native dedup for append; re-running
  produces duplicate rows. Operators wire dedup at the orchestrator
  level (e.g. write action_id into a hidden column + check before
  append).
- Column-key inference across heterogeneous row dicts (v1 assumes
  uniform key order).
- OAuth refresh, 429 backoff / retry.

Tests: 13 new in ``tests/test_sheets_real_adapter.py`` — real_mode
toggle (3), append endpoint + body + range + dry_run (4), update_cells
endpoint + body shape + dry_run (3), 401 / network / InvalidURL
redaction (3). All offline via ``httpx.MockTransport``.

### P1-003 — Google Calendar real adapter

Status: **Done (2026-05-15)** — Calendar adapter upgraded from
Sprint-0 stateful mock to mock-first + real-mode httpx-backed REST.
Bearer-only ``real_mode`` (issue-1 pattern); ``google_calendar_api_base``
defaults to ``https://www.googleapis.com`` (Calendar v3 lives under
``/calendar/v3/...`` on the unified Google APIs host). AST guard tuple
extended to cover calendar_mod alongside drive / docs / sheets — the
real-mode track now spans all four Google adapters.

Real-mode operations:
- ``google.calendar.create_event`` →
  ``POST /calendar/v3/calendars/{calendarId}/events``. Default
  calendarId ``"primary"`` (auth'd user's primary calendar); payload
  may override via ``calendar_id``. Body shape: ``{"summary": ...,
  "start": {"dateTime": ISO}, "end": {"dateTime": ISO}, "attendees":
  [{"email": ...}]}``. Email strings auto-wrapped into the Calendar
  API's expected object shape. The returned ``htmlLink`` is surfaced
  as ``external_url`` for click-through from the audit log.
- ``google.calendar.create_checkpoint_series`` → N create_event calls,
  one per offset (default ``(30, 14, 7, 1)`` days before deadline).
  **Partial-failure surface (issue-2 pattern from Docs)**: if some
  checkpoints succeed before one fails, the IDs of the created events
  are preserved in the dispatcher's error message so the operator
  can clean up. ``status=failed``, ``external_id=series_<hash>``,
  ``external_url`` points at the first created event.

Safety properties follow Plane / Drive / Docs / Sheets:
- Deep-review C1 — dry_run short-circuits BEFORE any HTTP call,
  returns ``dry_run_<sha1(title-or-competition_name)[:8]>``.
  Fallback to action_id when neither is present (issue-5 pattern).
- M8 + round-3 M4 — HTTPStatusError → ``safe_error_summary``;
  HTTPError + InvalidURL → ``safe_network_summary``. Event titles,
  attendee emails, calendarIds all carry user content.
- Stage-4 httpx guard now allows httpx in calendar_mod — the
  real-mode track is complete; all four Google adapters are
  exempted. Non-httpx libs (``requests``, ``urllib``, raw sockets)
  + Google SDKs remain banned across the board.

Return-shape divergence between mock and real (issue-4 pattern):
mock ``_mock_create_event`` returns the full stateful record
(``title``, ``start``, ``end``, ``attendees``, ``url``); real
``_real_create_event`` returns only ``{id, url}``. Dispatcher reads
only ``id`` + ``url`` so audit path is mode-agnostic; direct
callers of ``adapter.create_event(...)`` inspecting ``["attendees"]``
work on mock and ``KeyError`` on real. Docstring on the real method
flags this.

Out of scope (deferred follow-ups):
- RRULE / recurrence — single events only.
- Conference data (Meet / Hangouts link autocreation).
- Reminder overrides — uses calendar defaults.
- Timezone normalisation — caller-supplied ISO strings must carry
  tzinfo. Naive datetimes pass through; Calendar uses the
  calendar's primary timezone.
- OAuth refresh — operator-side via the access token field.
- 429 backoff / retry.

Tests: 15 new in ``tests/test_calendar_real_adapter.py`` — real_mode
toggle (3), create_event endpoint + body + calendar_id + attendees +
htmlLink (4), checkpoint series + partial-failure + explicit offsets
(3), dry_run safety on both (2), 401 + network + InvalidURL
redaction (3). All offline via ``httpx.MockTransport``.

``create_checkpoint_series`` return shape changed from flat list of
events to ``{"events": [...], "partial_failure": str | None}`` —
needed to surface partial-failure without losing the created IDs.
Updated mock-mode test in ``test_google_workspace_adapters.py``.

### P1-004 — Plane REST adapter

Status: **Done (2026-05-14)** — Plane adapter upgraded from Stage 0 stub
to mock-first + real-mode httpx-backed REST. Real mode activated when
all four Settings fields are present (``plane_base_url``,
``plane_api_key`` (SecretStr), ``plane_workspace_slug``,
``plane_project_id``); otherwise falls back to deterministic mock. Tests
use ``httpx.MockTransport`` so the suite stays offline. Tier 0 #3
closed — every executed audit record now surfaces ``target_external_id``
including Plane. Tier 0 #5 closed — real mode does GET-by-search before
POST, returning the existing issue on match (idempotent across repeated
approvals). Search-step failures degrade to plain POST so self-hosted
instances with search disabled still work. **C1 (2026-05-14) closed —
real mode now honors ``dry_run=True`` by short-circuiting BEFORE any
HTTP call and returning a synthetic ``dry_run_<sha1(title)[:8]>``
preview. Previously a preview against a fully-configured Plane would
silently create a real issue (Settings.dry_run_default=True is the
hot path).** **M7 (2026-05-14) closed — ``_search_existing_issue`` now
(a) caps the ``search`` query parameter at 512 chars so a 10 KiB title
cannot push the GET URL past typical proxy / origin limits and silently
lose idempotency via 414, and (b) raises immediately on 401 / 403
instead of degrading to POST, so auth misconfiguration surfaces at the
real failure point. Non-auth 4xx / 5xx / network / malformed JSON all
keep degrading to POST (self-hosted Plane with search disabled still
creates issues).** **M8 (2026-05-14) closed — HTTPStatusError audit
field now goes through ``adapters/_http_errors.py::safe_error_summary``
which extracts ONLY string values from JSON ``error``/``detail``/
``message`` fields and falls back to ``<status> <reason>`` for HTML /
opaque / nested bodies. Previously a self-hosted Plane 5xx HTML stack
trace could leak internal hostnames, file paths, and occasional env
fragments into PM-visible audit records via the 200-char raw body
echo. Output now hard-capped at 200 chars regardless of input size.
Same helper wired into ``google_drive.py`` for symmetry — captive
portals / corporate proxies also interpose HTML on Drive endpoints.**

### P1-005 — Drive folder creation / move files

Status: **In Progress (2026-05-14)** — Drive adapter upgraded from Stage 4
stateful mock to mock-first + real-mode httpx-backed REST. Real mode
activates when both ``Settings.google_oauth_access_token`` (SecretStr)
and ``Settings.google_drive_api_base`` are set; partial config falls
back to deterministic mock. ``create_folder`` does GET-by-search
(Drive ``files.list`` with name + mimeType + parent + trashed=false)
before POST, returning the existing folder on match (Tier 0 #5
idempotency). Search-step failures (4xx/5xx, network, malformed JSON)
degrade to POST so self-hosted Drive shims with broken search still
create folders. Deep-review C1 honored: real mode short-circuits
``dry_run=True`` to a synthetic ``dry_run_<hash>`` preview WITHOUT any
HTTP call, so ``Settings.dry_run_default=True`` can never accidentally
write to Drive. Tests use ``httpx.MockTransport`` so the suite stays
offline. ``move_file`` / ``search_files`` stay mock until a follow-up
sprint. The Stage 4 "no httpx in adapter source" guard relaxed to
allow generic HTTP in ``google_drive`` only (Docs / Sheets / Calendar
remain pure mocks until P1-001~003).

### P1-006 — Web ingestion through Playwright / Crawl4AI

Status: **Sprint 0 done (2026-05-15)** — scaffolding only. Port +
mock + Settings + runtime factory + ``POST /briefs/extract/url``
endpoint shipped; real adapter (Crawl4AI / Playwright direct) lands
in Sprint 2.

Sprint 0 surface:

- ``WebIngestionPort`` (``competitionops.ports``) — async
  ``fetch(url) -> WebIngestionResult``. ``WebIngestionResult`` is a
  Pydantic model carrying ``url`` (canonical post-redirect),
  ``title``, ``text``. Mirror of the P2-005 ``PdfIngestionPort``
  shape.
- ``MockWebAdapter`` (``competitionops.adapters.web_mock``) — two
  modes: registered fixtures via ``adapter.register(result)`` for
  integration tests; otherwise deterministic synthetic content keyed
  on the URL. No network. Records every fetch in ``.calls``.
- ``Settings.web_adapter: str | None`` — ``None`` / ``"mock"`` →
  mock; ``"crawl4ai"`` reserved for Sprint 2 (currently raises
  ``RuntimeError`` with operator guidance); unknown values raise
  ``ValueError`` via round-3 M1 eager-validate at ``main.py`` module
  init.
- ``runtime._web_adapter()`` — ``@lru_cache(1)`` factory symmetric
  to ``_pdf_adapter()``. Conftest autouse teardown clears the cache.
- ``main.get_web_adapter()`` — FastAPI dependency.
  ``main._eager_validate_runtime_config()`` calls ``_web_adapter()``
  alongside ``_pdf_adapter()`` so typo'd ``WEB_ADAPTER`` crashes
  uvicorn import (round-3 M1).
- ``POST /briefs/extract/url`` — body ``{"url": "https://..."}``,
  returns ``CompetitionBrief``. URL is validated for scheme at the
  Pydantic layer: only ``http(s)://`` accepted. ``file://``,
  ``javascript:``, ``data:``, ``ftp:`` etc. surface as 422 BEFORE
  the adapter is called — defence-in-depth for when Sprint 2 wires
  a browser engine that could read local files via ``file://``.
- ``pyproject.toml`` declares ``[project.optional-dependencies].web``
  (empty in Sprint 0) so the documented install command
  ``uv sync --extra web`` is valid today; Sprint 2 fills the list.

Sprint 0 tests: 14 new in ``tests/test_web_ingestion.py`` — port
shape (2), mock adapter behaviour (3), runtime factory +
eager-validate (4), endpoint plumbing including scheme validation
(4), pyproject extras declaration (1). All offline.

Sprint 1: **Done (2026-05-15)** — SSRF filter landed in
``_UrlIngestRequest`` validator. Two module-level helpers in
``main.py`` (kept module-local since only this endpoint uses them):

- ``_resolve_host_to_addresses(host)`` — IP literal path
  (``ipaddress.ip_address``) OR DNS path (``socket.getaddrinfo``).
  Returns ``[]`` on ``gaierror`` (lenient — unresolvable hosts can't
  reach internal infra anyway, and this keeps RFC-6761 ``.invalid``
  / ``.test`` URLs usable as offline test fixtures).
- ``_is_non_routable_address(addr)`` — predicate combining
  ``is_loopback | is_private | is_link_local | is_reserved |
  is_multicast | is_unspecified``. Covers RFC-1918 v4 + RFC-4193 v6
  ULA + 169.254/16 (incl. cloud metadata 169.254.169.254) +
  IPv6 fe80::/10 + reserved + multicast + unspecified ranges.

The validator resolves the URL's hostname and rejects (422) if ANY
resolved address falls in the banned set. Sprint 0's scheme allow-
list (http/https only) remains the first gate.

Known limitations (Sprint 2 transport concerns, not Sprint 1):

- **DNS rebinding** — a hostname resolves to a public IP at
  validation time, then to a private IP at fetch time. Sprint 1's
  validator only resolves once. Sprint 2 must either (a) pass the
  resolved IP into the HTTP client, or (b) use a custom transport
  that re-validates resolved IPs at connect time.
- **Lenient on resolution failure** — by design; see helper docstring.

Tests: 4 new in tests/test_web_ingestion.py covering 9 IP-literal
banned ranges, DNS path resolving to private IP, DNS path resolving
to public IP, gaierror leniency.

Sprint 2: **Done (2026-05-15)** — Crawl4AI real adapter ships behind
the ``[web]`` optional extra. ``WEB_ADAPTER=crawl4ai`` constructs
``Crawl4AIWebAdapter`` (lazy import, same pattern as Docling). On
first fetch the adapter imports ``crawl4ai.AsyncWebCrawler``,
constructs a fresh crawler per request (deterministic teardown),
calls ``arun(url=...)``, and maps the ``CrawlResult`` to our
``WebIngestionResult``:

- ``CrawlResult.url`` (canonical post-redirect) → ``url``
- ``CrawlResult.metadata['title']`` → ``title``
- ``CrawlResult.markdown`` (LLM-ready cleaned content) → ``text``
- ``CrawlResult.success=False`` → adapter raises ``RuntimeError``
  with the upstream ``error_message`` (e.g. ``net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED``).

Missing ``[web]`` extra surfaces as ``RuntimeError`` with operator
guidance (``uv sync --extra web``) on the FIRST fetch, not at
module import — so operators can stage the config flip ahead of the
extras install without breaking pod startup.

**Deployment note: DNS rebinding requires infra-layer mitigation.**
Sprint 1's Pydantic-layer SSRF filter resolves the hostname at
validation time, but Crawl4AI's Playwright backend owns its own DNS
stack and re-resolves at connect time. A malicious DNS server could
return a public IP to the validator and a private IP to the browser.
The adapter does NOT close this — operators MUST constrain egress
at the infrastructure layer:

- k8s ``NetworkPolicy`` that allows egress only to public IP ranges.
- Egress proxy that does IP validation per connect.
- Dedicated network namespace with restricted routing table.

See ``infra/k8s/README.md`` ("Enabling Crawl4AI") for the recommended
NetworkPolicy snippet AND the Playwright browser-cache setup
(``readOnlyRootFilesystem: true`` requires either a bake-into-image
build or an emptyDir mount + ``PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH``).

Tests: 4 new in ``tests/test_web_ingestion.py``, replacing the
Sprint-0 placeholder ``test_runtime_web_adapter_factory_rejects_crawl4ai_in_sprint_0``
per its docstring directive. Coverage:
1. Factory constructs Crawl4AIWebAdapter when env-toggled.
2. Missing ``crawl4ai`` package → clear RuntimeError on first fetch.
3. CrawlResult mapping (url + title + markdown → WebIngestionResult).
4. CrawlResult.success=False → RuntimeError with upstream message.

The four tests monkeypatch ``_resolve_async_web_crawler`` so they
run without installing the heavy ``[web]`` extra in CI.

## P2

### P2-001 — LangGraph workflow with human-in-the-loop

Status: **Done (2026-05-14)** — Five-node ``StateGraph`` (extract → plan →
approve → execute → audit) compiled with ``interrupt_before=["approve"]``
and a ``MemorySaver`` checkpointer. Caller invokes the graph, gets a
paused state after ``plan``, supplies ``approved_action_ids`` via
``graph.update_state``, then resumes — at which point the existing
``ExecutionService`` runs the approved actions through the mock-first
adapter registry and ``audit_node`` snapshots the resulting audit
records into final state. 11 tests cover state round-trip, each node's
invariant, the interrupt behavior (zero adapter calls before resume),
the post-approval execute + audit path, and ``MemorySaver`` persistence
across graph reconstruction (same ``thread_id`` survives a "process
restart"). Production deployments can swap the saver for
``SqliteSaver`` / ``PostgresSaver`` without changing the graph shape.

**M3 (2026-05-14) closed** — Accumulative state fields now declare
``Annotated[list[dict[str, Any]], operator.add]`` so LangGraph appends
parallel writes instead of raising ``InvalidUpdateError`` (which is
what default last-value-wins channels do on concurrent updates).
Locked-in fields: ``executed`` / ``skipped`` / ``failed`` /
``blocked`` (execute outputs) and ``audit_records``. Single-writer
fields (``brief`` / ``plan`` / ``rejected_action_ids`` / caller
inputs) deliberately stay unannotated so graph replay doesn't
accumulate duplicates. The current graph is linear so behaviour for
the happy path is identical, but the contract is now safe for a
future ``Send``-based fan-out (e.g. one execute task per action). 3
new tests cover: structural Annotated metadata for accumulative
fields, defence against over-application on single-writer fields,
and an end-to-end ``Send`` API parallel-writers proof (used to raise
``InvalidUpdateError`` before this PR; now both writers' records
survive in the final state).

**M4 (2026-05-14) closed** — Process-level singletons
(``_plan_repo`` / ``_audit_log`` / ``_registry``) moved out of
``competitionops.main`` (and the duplicate set in
``competitionops_mcp.server``) into a new neutral
``src/competitionops/runtime.py``. ``main`` / ``mcp_server`` /
``workflows.nodes`` all import from there. The workflow no longer
needs the local ``from competitionops import main as main_module``
hack to dodge a circular dependency. A future worker process
(Windmill executor / Celery / dedicated k8s Deployment) can run the
LangGraph workflow without pulling in FastAPI by importing
``competitionops.runtime`` directly. Test fixtures unchanged —
``main._plan_repo is runtime._plan_repo`` (same function object), so
existing ``main_module._plan_repo.cache_clear()`` calls still target
the canonical lru_cache. 9 new tests in ``tests/test_runtime.py``:
runtime module surface, env-driven plan_repo / audit_log switches,
``main`` and ``mcp_server`` factories are runtime factories
by-identity, structural guard that workflows/nodes contains no
``from competitionops import main`` import, and an end-to-end check
that ``audit_node`` runs without first instantiating the FastAPI app.

### P2-002 — Windmill workflow scripts

Status: **Done (2026-05-14)** — Three Windmill rawscripts under
``infra/windmill/scripts/`` (extract_brief / generate_plan /
approve_and_execute), each ``def main(...) -> dict`` reading
``WINDMILL_API_BASE`` from env. A flow YAML under
``infra/windmill/flows/competition_pipeline.yaml`` chains them with a
``suspend`` step where the PM picks ``approved_action_ids`` (7-day
timeout). README walks through importing the flow into a local
Windmill instance. 8 tests use ``httpx.MockTransport`` + ``TestClient``
so pytest never opens a real socket and all three scripts are
exercised both individually and as a composed pipeline.

### P2-003 — Kubernetes deployment

Status: **Done (2026-05-14)** — Kustomize base (deployment + service +
configmap + secret.template + pvc) plus three overlays (dev / staging /
prod), each shipping its own ``namespace.yaml``. Hardened pod posture:
distroless ``python3-debian12:nonroot`` image, uid 65532, dropped ALL
caps, read-only root fs, automountServiceAccountToken=false,
RuntimeDefault seccomp, readinessProbe on ``/health`` + livenessProbe
on ``/healthz``. PVC ``competitionops-audit`` (5Gi RWX) backs Tier 0
#4's ``AUDIT_LOG_DIR``; dev overlay swaps PVC for emptyDir for
minikube / kind without RWX. Prod overlay: 1 replica (H2-pinned, see below) +
podAntiAffinity + nginx ingress with cert-manager letsencrypt-prod +
20rps rate limit. Staging: same shape with letsencrypt-staging.
``secret.template.yaml`` ships with seven empty key placeholders —
real values flow via external-secrets / sealed-secrets / kubectl.
Multi-stage Dockerfile builds with uv into a distroless runtime. 31
manifest tests parse YAML directly (no kustomize CLI dep), 32nd smoke
test calls ``kustomize build`` per overlay if the binary is available.

**H1 (2026-05-14) closed** — Each overlay now ships its own
``namespace.yaml`` declaring ``Namespace/competitionops-{env}``. Base
no longer ships a Namespace resource or pins a default namespace.
Previously the base's ``Namespace/competitionops`` was the ONLY
Namespace rendered into every overlay (because kustomize's
``namespace:`` field cannot rename a Namespace kind — it only rewrites
``metadata.namespace`` on namespaced resources), so
``kubectl apply -k overlays/dev/`` would create
``Namespace/competitionops`` and then fail to place the Deployment
into ``competitionops-dev`` which never got created.

**H2 (2026-05-14) closed** — Prod overlay re-pinned to ``replicas: 1``.
``_plan_repo()`` is a process-bound singleton over
``InMemoryPlanRepository``; with >1 pod a plan created on pod A is
invisible to pod B and ``POST /plans/{plan_id}/approve`` returns 404
whenever the LB lands the approval on a different pod. The
``podAntiAffinity`` block stays in the patch so the spread intent
survives until a shared ``PlanRepository`` adapter (SQLite-on-PVC,
Postgres, or Redis) lands — at which point replicas can climb back.
Audit-log RWX PVC stays provisioned for the same future scale-up.
Inline comments at ``infra/k8s/overlays/prod/deployment-patch.yaml`` +
``src/competitionops/main.py::_plan_repo`` cross-reference the
dependency so it can't get silently bumped.

**H2 follow-up (2026-05-14, capability shipped)** —
``FilePlanRepository`` adapter lands under
``src/competitionops/adapters/file_plan_store.py``: one JSON file per
``plan_id``, atomic-rename save (``os.replace``) so multi-pod readers
on a shared volume see either the old complete file or the new
complete file — never a partial. ``_plan_repo()`` in both
``main.py`` and ``competitionops_mcp/server.py`` honors
``Settings.plan_repo_dir`` (env ``PLAN_REPO_DIR``), mirroring how the
audit log honors ``AUDIT_LOG_DIR`` (Tier 0 #4). 16 new tests cover
round-trip / overwrite / list_all / atomic-rename / path-traversal
sanitisation / two-instance cross-pod simulation / FastAPI full
lifecycle with simulated pod restart. **Pin stays at replicas=1** —
lifting it also requires the H3 audit-log multi-writer fix.

**H3 (2026-05-14) closed** — ``FileAuditLog`` now writes one file per
``(plan_id, writer_id)`` instead of a single shared
``<plan_id>.jsonl``. Filename format becomes
``<plan_id>.<writer_id>.jsonl`` where ``writer_id`` defaults to
``socket.gethostname()`` — in a k8s pod that's ``metadata.name``, so
each pod automatically owns its own file with zero extra wiring.
Because writers no longer share a file, the multi-writer torn-write
race the deep review flagged is impossible *by construction*
regardless of RWX filesystem semantics (no reliance on ``fcntl.flock``
which has unreliable behaviour on NFS / Azure Files / EFS).
``list_for_plan`` globs ``<plan_id>.*.jsonl`` and merges across
writers, plus picks up the legacy ``<plan_id>.jsonl`` form for
in-place upgrades. 8 new tests cover: writer_id defaults to hostname /
explicit writer_id in filename / two writers two files / merge across
writers / no leak across plan_ids / 300-record multi-writer volume
test / writer_id path-traversal sanitisation / legacy single-file
backward compat. Pin stays at replicas=1 as deployment-policy default
— lifting it is now a one-line manifest change once operators wire
``PLAN_REPO_DIR``.

### P2-004 — Observability with OpenTelemetry

Status: **In Progress** — Sprint 0 (tracer bootstrap) ✅, Sprint 2
(ExecutionService root + adapter_call spans) ✅, Sprint 3 (root-span
plan_id/actor attributes, adapter_call plan_id, result.status=failed →
span STATUS=ERROR mapping, M1 OTel auto-exception coverage) ✅,
Sprint 4 (FastAPI auto-instrumentation via FastAPIInstrumentor +
six MCP tool spans `mcp.tool.*` with attribute coverage; shared
decorators extracted to `telemetry/decorators.py`) ✅,
Sprint 5 (Counter `competitionops.actions.total` per lifecycle state,
Counter `competitionops.audit.records.total` per AuditRecord, Histogram
`competitionops.action.execution.duration_seconds` per adapter dispatch;
MeterProvider bootstrap via `setup_meter_provider(readers=...)`) ✅.

Sprint 6 — opt-in OTLP / console exporter wiring driven by env
(``OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`` for OTLP gRPC, requires ``uv sync
--extra otel``; ``COMPETITIONOPS_OTEL_CONSOLE=1`` for console dev mode,
no extra needed). Default behavior unchanged — exporters stay off unless
explicitly opted in. ✅

Sprint 6+ — OTel ``Resource`` attributes (2026-05-16) ✅. Before this,
``TracerProvider()`` / ``MeterProvider()`` were constructed with no
``resource=``, so the SDK default ``service.name`` was
``unknown_service:python`` — every exported trace + metric landed
unattributed in Jaeger / Grafana / Tempo, undermining the whole
P2-004 investment. ``telemetry/setup.py`` gains ``_build_resource()``
which composes ``service.name`` (``OTEL_SERVICE_NAME`` env, else
``competitionops-api``) + ``service.version`` (installed package
version via ``importlib.metadata``). ``deployment.environment`` and
arbitrary operator attributes flow in through the OTel-standard
``OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES`` env, which ``Resource.create`` merges
automatically — no custom env var invented. Both
``setup_tracer_provider`` and ``setup_meter_provider`` now pass the
resource into their provider constructors. 6 new tests in
``tests/test_otel_resource.py``.

P2-004 main track complete. Remaining: optional polish (metric
attribute naming review — non-blocking).

**M1 + M2 (2026-05-15) closed** — Two install-order footguns in the
OTel bootstrap surfaced for the first time. M1: when a MeterProvider
was already installed (e.g. ``tests/test_metrics.py``'s session
fixture had run), ``setup_meter_provider(readers=[...])`` silently
returned the existing provider and dropped the requested readers on
the floor — OTel SDK has no API to add readers post-construction.
``test_wire_otel_exporters_*_runs_without_error`` would pass while
the OTLP / Console exporters were never wired. After the fix, that
silent-drop branch raises ``OtelInstallOrderError`` with operator
guidance. M2: ``main.py`` previously called ``setup_tracer_provider``
twice (once at module-init, once inside ``_wire_otel_exporters``).
The wiring path now uses ``trace.get_tracer_provider()`` with an
isinstance check, so module-init is the single root of TracerProvider
installation; if module-init was bypassed (or an embedder swapped in a
non-SDK provider) the wiring raises rather than attaching span
processors to a Proxy. 5 new tests cover: happy path + readers-on-
empty-provider + readers-with-already-installed (raises) + AST
structural guard that the wiring function no longer calls
``setup_tracer_provider`` + isinstance failure raises. The two
existing ``runs_without_error`` smoke tests upgraded to also assert
the MeterProvider was actually installed (was passing for the wrong
reason).

### P2-005 — Local OCR / layout parsing with GPU

Status: **Sprint 0-3 Done (2026-05-15)** — ``PdfIngestionPort``
Protocol (``extract(pdf_bytes) -> str``) + ``MockPdfAdapter`` (strips
``%PDF-`` header, decodes the rest as UTF-8 — Sprint 0).
``BriefExtractor.extract_from_pdf(pdf_bytes)`` glues the port to the
existing text extractor and computes
``source_uri = "pdf://" + sha1(bytes)[:16]`` for audit-linkable
provenance (Sprint 1). ``POST /briefs/extract/pdf`` multipart endpoint
accepts ``UploadFile`` with a 10 MiB hard cap (413) + ``%PDF-`` magic
check (422); the Stage 5 OpenAPI guard now skips multipart bodies
since they don't carry a JSON schema (Sprint 2). Sprint 3 (2026-05-15)
lands ``DoclingPdfAdapter`` for real layout-aware extraction —
opt-in via ``PDF_ADAPTER=docling`` and ``uv sync --extra ocr`` (heavy
ML deps so default install stays light). ``runtime._pdf_adapter()``
factory switches on ``Settings.pdf_adapter`` with deterministic
``ValueError`` on unknown values (prevents silent fallback on operator
typo) and a friendlier ``RuntimeError`` pointing at the install path
when ``docling`` is missing. Sprints 4 (GPU) and 5 (Drive path)
deferred — they need either ``--extra ocr-gpu`` (future) or P1-005
real Drive adapter.

**M6 (2026-05-15) closed** — ``POST /briefs/extract/pdf`` now resolves
the adapter through ``Depends(get_pdf_adapter)`` instead of
constructing ``MockPdfAdapter()`` inline. Tests inject stubs via
``app.dependency_overrides`` without monkey-patching anything. A
structural AST guard (``test_pdf_upload_endpoint_does_not_hard_code_mock_pdf_adapter``)
walks the handler source and fails if a ``MockPdfAdapter(`` Call node
ever reappears. 10 new tests cover Settings field, runtime factory
defaults / explicit-mock / unknown-value-raises / singleton / port
satisfaction, endpoint DI replacement, AST structural guard, lazy
ImportError-when-missing path; 3 additional integration tests behind
``pytest.importorskip("docling")`` exercise the real engine after
``uv sync --extra ocr``.

**Round-2 H1 + H2 (2026-05-15) closed** — round-2 deep review flagged
two related issues in the Docling adoption path. **H1**: the
``async def extract_brief_from_pdf`` handler called
``extractor.extract_from_pdf(contents)`` directly. ``pdf_port.extract``
is sync; with ``PDF_ADAPTER=docling`` it runs 10-60s of ML inference
on a real PDF — blocking the worker's event loop for that duration,
which (combined with prod's H2 ``replicas: 1`` pin) is a cluster-wide
stall. Fix: wrap the call in ``fastapi.concurrency.run_in_threadpool``.
**H2**: ``DoclingPdfAdapter.extract`` bound ``tmp_path = Path(handle.name)``
AFTER ``handle.write(pdf_bytes)`` inside the ``with NamedTemporaryFile``
block. An OSError on write (disk full / quota) propagated past the
assignment, leaving ``tmp_path`` unbound and bypassing the outer
``try/finally`` cleanup — orphan ``.pdf`` files accumulated under
``$TMPDIR``. Fix: capture ``tmp_path`` first, move ``write_bytes`` into
the ``try`` body. 4 new tests: behavioural event-loop probe (stub
adapter checks ``asyncio.get_running_loop()`` raises iff offloaded),
AST structural guard that the handler invokes ``run_in_threadpool``,
AST ordering guard that ``tmp_path`` binds before any failable op in
``DoclingPdfAdapter.extract``, AST guard that the cleanup ``unlink``
lives inside a ``finally:`` block. The AST tests don't import
docling so they run on every CI without ``--extra ocr``.

**Round-2 M7 + M8 (2026-05-15) closed** — defence-in-depth against two
adapter information-leak surfaces. **M7**: ``plane_base_url`` and
``google_drive_api_base`` were plain ``str`` fields. An operator
typo like ``https//www.googleapis.com`` (missing colon) flowed into
the adapter URL builder and surfaced as an opaque httpx
``ConnectError`` at the first API call — not at startup. Fix: a
shared ``_validate_http_url`` helper called by ``@field_validator``
on both fields. Requires ``http://`` or ``https://`` scheme +
non-empty host; strips trailing slash; rejects empty string and
mid-scheme typos. **M8 round-2**: the ``except httpx.HTTPError``
non-status branch in Plane/Drive still rendered ``str(exc)``, which
httpx populates with the request URL — and our search URLs embed
user content (Drive's ``q=name='<folder>'``, Plane's
``search=<title>``). Token-like substrings in folder names / issue
titles would leak via that branch. Fix: new
``adapters/_http_errors.py::safe_network_summary`` returns
``"{target} network error: {ExceptionClassName}"`` and drops the
body entirely. Wired into both adapters' ``HTTPError`` branches
mirroring the round-1 ``safe_error_summary`` pattern. 25 new tests:
16 Settings validator (well-formed accept / typo reject / empty
reject / slash strip / None for optional / default for required) +
9 helper unit (drop-exc-body / target-prefix / parametrized sweep
of 6 httpx error classes / length cap). The two existing adapter
network-error tests upgraded — previously asserted ``"synthetic"
in error`` (the exact leak surface); now assert the class name IS
in the error AND the leak token is NOT.

**Round-2 M3 + M4 (2026-05-15) closed** — operational gaps closing
the H2-lift and Docling-deploy paths so operators don't discover
missing wiring at first request. **M3**: ``infra/k8s/base/configmap.yaml``
now ships commented ``PLAN_REPO_DIR`` (pointing at
``/var/lib/competitionops/audit/plans``, a subdir of the existing
audit PVC mount — zero infra change to lift the H2 pin) and
``PDF_ADAPTER`` placeholders. The H2 operator checklist in
``infra/k8s/README.md`` rewritten to name the configmap step and
the H3-build verification step explicitly. **M4**:
``infra/docker/Dockerfile`` exposes an ``INCLUDE_OCR`` build-arg
(``${INCLUDE_OCR:+--extra ocr}`` shell expansion adds Docling only
when non-empty). Default build stays slim; operators flipping
``PDF_ADAPTER=docling`` build with ``docker build --build-arg
INCLUDE_OCR=1 ...``. New README section "Enabling Docling" documents
the build-arg + configmap pair. 7 new tests: 3 configmap placeholder
guards (key in raw text, key NOT in active ``cm.data``, default path
references the audit subdir), 2 Dockerfile structural guards
(INCLUDE_OCR arg declared, default empty so slim build is preserved),
2 README content guards (H2 checklist references configmap +
INCLUDE_OCR pair).

**Round-2 M5 (2026-05-15) closed** — round-1 M3 added
``Annotated[list[...], operator.add]`` to the five accumulative
state fields; round-2 review pointed out a paired hazard: the
``execute_node`` and ``audit_node`` bodies both return FULL
SNAPSHOTS of upstream stores (``ExecutionService.approve_and_execute``
response and ``audit_log.list_for_plan(plan_id)`` respectively).
The linear graph runs each node once so the reducer is harmless;
a future ``Send``-based fan-out where parallel sub-tasks re-query
the same store would have every sub-task emit the same snapshot
and ``operator.add`` would N-tuple the data. The fix is
documentation, NOT a premature node restructure (fan-out hasn't
been designed yet, and weakening the reducer would defeat round-1
M3). ``workflows/state.py`` module docstring grew a "snapshot-vs-
delta invariant" section spelling out the failure mode by name;
``execute_node`` and ``audit_node`` docstrings cross-reference it
with concrete "do NOT just wrap this body in Send" guidance. 3
new tests assert each docstring contains both ``snapshot`` and a
``fan-out`` / ``Send`` reference, so the warning can't be
silently removed by a refactor.

**Round-3 H1 + H2 (2026-05-15) closed** — round-3 audit caught two
operator-onboarding regressions hidden by my dev venv accidentally
carrying stale ``--extra langgraph`` from prior sessions. **H1**:
``langgraph`` lived only in ``[project.optional-dependencies]``, so
``uv sync && uv run pytest`` (the documented onboarding flow) on a
FRESH checkout aborted collection with
``ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'langgraph'`` after 387 tests
gathered. All 21 prior PRs' "400 passed" results were valid only
inside venvs that happened to keep the extra installed; CI from
scratch was broken. Fix: ``langgraph`` + ``langgraph-checkpoint``
added to ``[dependency-groups].dev`` (PEP 735) so the default
``uv sync`` covers them; ``[project.optional-dependencies].langgraph``
kept for the ``pip install .[langgraph]`` operator path. **H2**:
round-2 PR #18's URL validator rejected empty strings on
``plane_base_url``; ``infra/k8s/base/secret.template.yaml`` ships
``PLANE_BASE_URL: ""`` as a placeholder. Applying the template
unmodified → ``Settings()`` ``ValidationError`` → uvicorn import
fails → CrashLoopBackoff. Fix: ``_validate_http_url`` gains a
``treat_empty_as_none=True`` flag, applied to ``plane_base_url``
(empty becomes None → mock mode, semantically "no Plane wired");
``google_drive_api_base`` keeps strict rejection (it has a non-empty
default; empty IS a typo). Secret template header docstring grew an
explicit note explaining the empty-string semantics. 6 new tests
across 2 files: 4 structural pyproject guards (langgraph in dev,
checkpoint pinned alongside, optional-extra retained, test
module re-imports cleanly), 2 settings guards (empty plane_base_url
resolves to None, full secret-template env round-trips through
Settings without raising).

**M5 (2026-05-14) closed** — PDF upload handler now reads the body in
1 MiB chunks and raises 413 the moment accumulated bytes overshoot
the 10 MiB cap. Before this fix, ``contents = await file.read()`` with
no size argument materialised the entire upload into a single Python
``bytes`` object before the size check ran, so a Content-Length: 10 GiB
client could OOM the pod even though the request was clearly
oversized. Three regression tests guard the fix: a spy verifies the
handler never calls ``read()`` without a positive size argument; a
behavioural test sends a 15 MiB body and asserts the total bytes read
stay under ``limit + 2 MiB`` chunk-overshoot allowance; a structural
test greps the handler source for ``file.read()`` to catch silent
reverts.
